# ThreeJS based OpenWorlds client

This repository contains the experimental OpenWorlds client code. It currently expects the
OpenWorlds server to be running locally, to grab the world property data to render. Please
note that at the moment it will try to render _all_ property in the world.

## TODO:

* Finish RWXLoader to an acceptable level.
* Implement avatar loading and animation (nested RWX clumps).
* Implement world attribute configuration in OpenWorlds Server and use it here.
